# shairport-sync-showmeta
Simple websocket-based React app that displays metadata from `https://github.com/mikebrady/shairport-sync` in a browser, built for use with the Raspberry Pi 800x480 touchscreen LCD.

I use `https://github.com/SteveMacAwesome/shairport-sync-readmeta` to extract the metadata and serve the built version of this app.
